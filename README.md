# **Oahu Ice Cream & Surf Shop Weather Analysis**

## **Overview**

Our analysis starts with W.Avy's inquiry about temperature trends in reference to opening a surf shop in Oahu. He has tasked us with analyzing the temperature data for the specific months of June and December in Oahu to see if his ice cream and surf shop business will be sustainable year-round. 

### **The Analysis**

After our data analysis, we were able to conclude the following points:

* Temperatures in June range significantly higher and more frequently than in December.
* Temperatures in the month of December go above 80 degrees much less frequently than in June.
* Temperatures drop much lower more frequently in December than in June. 

In our data analysis, we were able to query the data and find that the temperatures for the month of June range significantly higher and more frequently than in December. As we can see in the images and charts:

As shown in the data above, the temperature ranges in June provide a much more comforting business analysis for W'Avy than in December. With an average temperature of 74.9 degrees in June as opposed to 71.04 degrees average in December. The average is approximately a 4 degrees difference, however the temperatures in June range from 75 to 80 degrees much more frequently which should be great for W'Avy's surf and ice cream shop. 

For the month of December, the temperatures are generally still above 70 degrees, which isn't as hot as in June, but possibly still sustainable in a business sense for W'Avy. Although the temperatures drop to approximately 69 degrees 25% of the time, on average, they are still above 71 degrees 50% of the time and approximately 74 degrees 75% of the time. 

## **Additional Queries **

Some additional queries we can add would be a precipitation analysis. W'Avy may want to view the amount of precipitation in reference to surfing weather just as well as the temperature. The average number of inches of rain can possibly affect surfing weather, just as much as temperature would affect ice cream weather. We were able to add two additional queries in the "Additional Queries" section of our code located on the bottom. This would provide W'Avy with the data required for the months of June and December to analyze in reference to optimal surfing weather.  

We can also help W'Avy visualize on which part of the month it often rains as well as how much it rains in the charts below:

## **Conclusion**

In conclusion, our data analysis has touched on all the points W'Avy has requested in reference to temperature as well as an additional precipitation analysis as well. With the additional queries into the database and charts, we were able to get a bigger visual of how the weather would affect the ice cream and surf shop. We can conclude the temperature will generally be above 70 degrees for both months and that the precipitation is generally below 0.15 inches of rain 75% of the time. W'Avy can now utlize all the data to have a greater understanding along with visuals to make his business decision!
